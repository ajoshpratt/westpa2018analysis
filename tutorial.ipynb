WESTPA comes with tools that can calculate these properties using either of the following methods:\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Direct calculation (*i.e.*, directly tracing trajectories and directly calculating properties)\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools, known as **w_reweight** and **w_direct**, appropriately, require that your parameter space is split into bins and that some bins correspond to a known 'state'.  The tool that accomplishes this is known as **w_assign**, which bins and assigns trajectory walkers (or *segments*) into different steady-state ensembles and places the output into a file called **assign.h5**, by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**w_reweight/w_direct** will calculate and average rate constants, fluxes, and state populations according to whatever averaging scheme you choose.  Importantly, in a typical project, **you may wish to use various state definitions and/or averaging schemes!**."
